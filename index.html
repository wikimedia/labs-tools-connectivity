<h1>motivation</h1>

<p align=justify>
MediaWiki among other things collects two lists:
orphaned and deadend pages. Lets see how good they are.
</p>
<p align=justify>
It is important to understand what the difference between page and article is.
Page is everything in main namespace, which is not a redirect, including
disambiguation pages. The page is linked when any link from other page points
to the page we are considering. Even when this link is from other namespaces
(page has been considered to be deleted e.g. or just a discussion about this
page taken place somewhere) or from a disambiguation page (disambiguations are
not to be linked, so links from disambiguations do not help connecting articles 
one to another).
</p>

<p align=justify>MediaWiki also does not recognise links from lists or
chronological articles.
Such links are rarely relevant and nobody usually came from them. Other rules
can also be introduced when we need to understand how well connected our
articles are.</p>

<p align=justify>Thinking about connectivity we may need to consider more
than just orphanes. There may be a group of two, three or more pages connecting
each other but without any links from outside of the group, 
i.e. isolated clusters (or strongly connected components).
One cluster may link other and there may be
a chain of isolated clusters, which is not linked from the main connected 
component containing most part of good articles. MediaWiki does not recognize
isolated articles at all.</p>

<p align=justify>When MediaWiki locates dead-end pages it looks if the
page contain a link. It doesn't matter for the engine if this link is
set from a template and just talks about some problems in a page or the
link is to an article. Links to disambiguation pages are also threated
as valid by the engine.</p>

<p align=justify>Connectivity analysis for articles allows to authors
make their articles better adding them an attention of other people, who
are authors of other articles or just readers following links.</p>

<p align=justify>One more point to begin with connectivity analysis is that
this task is usually solved with procedural languages analyzing offline
links bases.
In order to make the connectivity data more actual it is necessary to
run the analyzer closer to severs to avoid large data transmittal. So,
it is required to be written in SQL, and there were no SQL solutions
for oriented graph connectivity analysis introduced. So, here we go.</p>

<h2>scope</h2>
<p align=justify>Let suppose we have an article defined as non-redirect and 
non-disambiguation page from the main namespace. Let also suppose article has
a link from other article if this is a direct or redirected link from 
non-chronological article (can be easily disabled if necessary). Let suppose 
the article is not a dead-end page if it contains one or more links to other
existent articles.</p>

<p align=justify>The following tasks are now solved:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Dead-end articles list according to the above definition</li>
 <li>Orphaned articles list according to the above definition</li>
 <li>All types of isolated clusters and chains of isolated clusters,
     which are present and have size less than some threshold</li>
</ul>

<p align=justify>Tasks solved by the way:</p>
<ul>
 <li>List multiple redirects, which for unknown reason is more
     complete than the list MediaWiki produces</li>
 <li>List of wrong redirects (having uncommented text with links after
     redirection magic.</li>
 <li>Statistics on isolated clusters amount for different types of
     clusters</li>
 <li>Data for querying isolated articles by authors and categories</li>
 <li>Suggestions on isolated articles resolving based on resolving
     links to disambiguations, and interwiki lookup.</li>
</ul>

<h2>how does it work</h2>
<p align=justify>There are two mains scrips. One is <a href="http://fisheye.ts.wikimedia.org/browse/mashiah/isolated/isolated.sh">isolated.sh</a>,
it runs on hemlock to drive the process. The second script <a href="http://fisheye.ts.wikimedia.org/browse/mashiah/isolated/isolated.sql">isolated.sql</a>
is called by isolated.sh, works yarrow (for ruwiki at the moment) and does 
all the connectivity analysis. When some sort of articles is found,
the sql scripts puts some command to stdout, which is controlled by
isolated.sh, and switches the output handler to put data to a file,
upload it to Wikipedia or do something specific.</p>

<p align=justify>Hope, following above links more data on how does connectivity
analysis work can be found.</p>

<h3>what's wrong with it</h3>
<p align=justify>It is ok for 200 000 articles, but for enwiki it is too slow yet.</p>
<p align=justify>AWB is actually used to apply the data (set/remove some templates).
Will be solved when my stupid brain overcome the task of templates management in perl, or
may be when one or more smart brains will come with their help.</p>
